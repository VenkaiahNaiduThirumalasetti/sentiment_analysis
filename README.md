Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a technique used to extract and analyze subjective information from text data. It involves the use of natural language processing, machine learning, and other computational methods to identify and classify the emotional tone or attitude expressed in a piece of text.
I have done the below analysis for twitter
By using the keyword as "ucm" with "40" number of tweets .
Out of the total text data analyzed, 32.5% were identified as expressing a positive sentiment, 60% were classified as neutral, and 7.5% were categorized as negative.
This means that the majority of the text data had a neutral sentiment, indicating that the language used was objective and did not convey a strong positive or negative emotion. The smaller percentage of negative results suggests that there were some instances of negative sentiment expressed in the text data, while the positive results indicate that there were also some instances of positive sentiment.
